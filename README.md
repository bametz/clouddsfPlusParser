# CloudDSF+ Parser
Parser for the [CloudDSF+](https://github.com/bametz/clouddsfPlus). The parser reads the knowledge base file and creates two JSON files as output. The files are used as input for the [CloudDSF+](https://github.com/bametz/clouddsfPlus) visualizations that entail some visualizations of the [CloudDSF](https://github.com/adarsow/clouddsf).
